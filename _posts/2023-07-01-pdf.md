Twitch project with 2 streamers about creating a competition for viewers in 2 teams over several months

Content was made on both channels, primarily on [Hugo's](https://www.twitch.tv/hugojd_) and also on [my channel](https://www.twitch.tv/aliandre_)

Viewers gained points in Skill, Art, Commu and Culture categories, every stream. The team with the most points each month won the month, for a BO5. There was a 3-2 final score, making a 5 month contest from July to November.
