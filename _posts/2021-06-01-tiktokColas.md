Creation from scratch of a brand new Tiktok channel for Colas Bim

Reuse content made on the main Twitch channel which was not used on the main gaming youtube channel, more focusing on drawing tutorials and streamer to viewer Q&A.

My role was to choose which stream parts to use, propose videos, artistic direction of the channel, edit the videos and post them. 5 videos per week.

Personal best of:
- [A hand-drawn funny animation over photoshop content](https://www.tiktok.com/@colasbim_/video/7007420754392272134)
- [First video of Colas](https://www.tiktok.com/@colasbim_/video/7019294071034268934) and [his journey](https://www.tiktok.com/@colasbim_/video/7018564114813406469) in a marketing operation with Adobe Photoshop
- [Drawing tutorial on circles](https://www.tiktok.com/@colasbim_/video/6992219812340468997)
- [Drawing tutorial on colors](https://www.tiktok.com/@colasbim_/video/7028223588285140229)
- [Tutorial on color keying](https://www.tiktok.com/@colasbim_/video/7008910079747493126)
- [Sport motivation](https://www.tiktok.com/@colasbim_/video/7033024254350249222)

Channel has stopped as the focus is now more Youtube than bringing people on Twitch. 138 videos of mostly 1 min were made over 7 months, and the channel reached 280k subscribers when stopped.
